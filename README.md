# Flight_Delay_Prediction
# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction Using Machine Learning

Flight delays affect millions of passengers annually, leading to increased operational costs and customer dissatisfaction. This project applies modern **Machine Learning** techniques to build an accurate, data-driven model for predicting flight delays.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive workflow for flight delay prediction. By analyzing flight schedule data and other relevant attributes, the goal is to forecast whether a flight will be delayed or arrive on time.

It leverages:

- ✈️ Real-world flight data and categorical variables like carrier, origin, and scheduled departure
- 📊 Data preprocessing and feature engineering for model-ready datasets
- 🤖 Machine learning models for classification and prediction

The primary objectives are:

1. Build a predictive system that accurately classifies flight status (Delayed or On-Time)
2. Understand which features most significantly impact delays

## 🚀 Features

- 🧹 Data cleaning and transformation
- 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ⚙️ Feature engineering
- 🧮 Model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- 🔍 Evaluation using metrics like Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1-score
- 📊 Visual comparison of model performance
- 🔍 Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualizations

## 📄 Project Description

> Flight delays are not only inconvenient but also costly. Predicting them accurately can help stakeholders make informed decisions, allocate resources more efficiently, and improve traveler experience.

> This project uses historical flight data to build predictive models that can classify whether a flight will be delayed or not. The machine learning models are trained and validated on preprocessed datasets using standard metrics. Key emphasis is placed on data visualization and feature importance analysis to ensure the model is interpretable and reliable.

> The focus is also on comparing different classification models to determine which best balances performance and explainability in real-world scenarios.
